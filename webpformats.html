<b>Uncompressed BGRA Format (*.bgra)</b>
<p>
BGRA is an uncompressed binary image format. Each pixel is represented by a sequence of 
4 bytes, 1 byte each for the blue, green, red, and alpha channels (in that order).<p>
The first 2 bytes in the file is the image width value, followed by 2 bytes for the image height value. 
The width and height values are stored as 16-bit little-endian integers giving a maximum image 
dimension of 65536 x 65536 pixels.<p>
Pixels are drawn from the top left to the top right and then down.

<b>Image List Format (*.lst)</b>
<P>
An image list is a plain text file with the filenames of supported images. Each image filename 
is on a new line, and can be a full file path, or a relative file path (relative to the 
containing .lst file).<p>
Images can be from different folders and drives, or all from the same folder.<p>
Navigation between images can be done using the Next, Previous, or Random image function.<p>
<p>
Example .lst file contents:<p>
<i>
C:\Pictures\Image001.jpg<br>
C:\Pictures\Image002.jpg<br>
C:\Images\Sunset.jpg<br>
MyImages\Sunrise.jpg<br>
</i>
